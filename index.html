                <h2>About Me :D</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm <strong>Yuyang Luo</strong> (Roman), a passionate <strong>Computer Science & Game Design</strong> student at the <strong>University of California, Santa Cruz</strong>. With a GPA of <strong>3.93</strong>, I strive to combine my technical expertise with creative innovation to design immersive and engaging gaming experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a strong foundation in programming languages like <strong>C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript</strong>, as well as hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as <strong>Unity3D</strong>, <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>, and <strong>Blender</strong>. My projects range from building AI-driven chess games and FPS prototypes to crafting dynamic overworlds using procedural content generation techniques like <strong>Perlin noise</strong> and <strong>Wave Function Collapse</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I lead the <strong>UCSC Overwatch Esports Team</strong>, honing teamwork and strategy both in-game and in real-world collaborative projects. Iâ€™ve also contributed as a <strong>Technical Support Specialist</strong>, automating workflows and improving IT systems on campus, and as an <strong>Undergraduate Researcher</strong>, exploring cutting-edge methods in game design and PCG.
                </p>
                <p>
